                    <h4>My Journey</h4>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I began my journey into full stack development with a strong curiosity for both frontend and backend technologies.
                        Starting with foundational skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I soon expanded into modern frameworks
                        like React and Django to build responsive, dynamic interfaces. On the backend, I dove into Django REST Framework, mastering how to
                        build APIs, manage databases with MySQL, and handle user authentication securely with JWT. </p>
                    <p>Alongside full stack development, I‚Äôve also been building my skills in data analysis. My journey began with tools like Excel and SQL for organizing and querying data, and I later expanded into using Python libraries such as Pandas for deeper analysis. I‚Äôve worked on identifying trends, cleaning datasets, and creating insightful visualizations to support decision-making.</p>

                    <p>Today, I continue to grow, driven by a passion for building scalable web applications, some of which leverage data analysis to tell meaningful stories and support informed decisions.</p>
